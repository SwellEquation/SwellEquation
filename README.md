- 👋 Hi, I’m @SwellEquation
- 👀 I’m interested in BeatSaber, CyberSecurity, fnf modding, game development, and hardware modification
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to draw, make FNF mods, create BeatSaber charts, and how to use VSC.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my FNF mod when I feel like I'm in a good place to create a team
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord @swellequation
